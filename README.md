# MATH128A
## Collection of algorithms written for my numerical analysis class at Berkeley. Some were made with help from the textbook's pseudocode.

MATH128Acode.py was written week-by-week over the course of the semester to solve various homework problems. The class provided some of them already-written in MATLAB, but those were glitchy, inconsistent, and I wanted Python practice, so I didn't bother looking at them and instead wrote my own. modifiedzeroin_DRAFT.py was written in a couple days as the first draft of the final project in Python, which I optimized and translated to MATLAB for submission (which was modifiedzeroin.m).
