# MATH128A
Collection of algorithms written for my numerical analysis class at Berkeley. Some were made with help from the textbook's pseudocode.

MATH128Acode.py was written week-by-week over the course of the semester to solve various homework problems, so there's a lack of good organization. modifiedzeroin_DRAFT.py was written in a couple days as the first draft of the final project in Python, which I optimized and translated to MATLAB for submission (which was modifiedzeroin.m).
